Engineers & Enchanters is a Magic Vs Tech Modpack almost perfectly (in numbers) split between Magic and Tech, as well as many exploration mods to ensure you do not get bored (Quests Coming Soon) This is mostly intended for Multiplayer but shouldn't Stop you from playing single player (Community server is currently in a closed beta soon we will open up an application process) its mostly intended for a sort of Roleplay RPG Style w/ PVP Mechanics mostly PVE though, I (SimplyKamu) have worked pretty much my heart and soul into this pack and its by far my favorite project yet and I sure hope you enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed Developing it!
