# HybridSMP
A Forge Modded OriginsSMP https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hybridsmp




This Pack was designed around the aspect of, Magic Vs Tech in mind. Personal Favorite magic mods, some new ones, along with Tech. This was designed specifically for an Origins SMP type deal but anyone can play with it in Singleplayer! Well known magic mods Include Ars Nouveau. as well as some tech mods include Mekanism, and Create (including cross mod compatibility Addons) I wanted this pack to at least appeal to the eyes of all modded players, as well as having Origins included to be able to play with Origins and along these really cool mods.
